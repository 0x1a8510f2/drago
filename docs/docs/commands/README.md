# Drago Commands (CLI)

Drago is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Drago is only a single command-line application: drago, which takes a subcommand such as "agent" or "status". The complete list of subcommands is in the navigation to the left.

To view a list of the available commands at any time, just run Drago with no arguments. To get help for any specific subcommand, run the subcommand with the -h argument.
